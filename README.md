The code for the Blurt Marketplace mobile app.

A working (not bug-free) demo is available for all mobile webkit browsers [here](http://blurt.maximeliron.com/marketplace/demo/).

Most of the magic happens in the `content` directory.

Tools used: CoffeeScript, Sass, Spine.js and Nanoc3 (for building while in development).
